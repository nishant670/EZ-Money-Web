            <section><h2>One-time purchase; no automatic renewal</h2><p>Finnri currently creates a separate one-time payment for each pass. There is no automatic debit mandate. Access ends after the stated duration unless you explicitly buy another pass; buying early queues the new paid period after an active period.</p></section>
            <section><h2>Lifetime access</h2><p>Lifetime access is not available through self-serve checkout. Eligible customers with at least three paid months may request an individual quote from inside Finnri. Any quote states its price and terms before payment.</p></section>

Finnri may change prices for future purchases, but a change does not shorten a pass already paid for.</p><p className="mt-5"><Link href="/login">Open Finnri to choose a plan</Link></p></section>
